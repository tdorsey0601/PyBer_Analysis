Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

The goal of this project was to analyze data for a ridesharing company called PyBer. We had to calculate metrics related to the total weekly fares for each city type in which the company operates in. For each city type datasets containing ride and city data were used to calculate total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and drivers. The analysis dataframe was used to generate a multiline graph that showed the total weekly fares for each city type within specific times.

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

Observe and analyze disparities in the city types provided. From the dataframes it shows that urban cities have the most rides and drivers whereas rural cities had the least amount. As shown in the results for the Total Fare column, the urban city type generates the most revenue whereas the city type rural generates the least. When we look at the Average Fare per ride column, we see that rural city types show the highest average fare per ride, meaning there is a higher chance of revenue in rural cities for every ride increase compared to urban city types which is the lowest average fare per ride.

Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

The dataframe shows total travel, total drivers, total fares, average fares per trip and average fares per drivers for each city type. This data included 66 cities, 36 suburbs and 18 local cities. There was a total of 1,625 trips in the urban cities which was the highest and 125 total trips in the rural cities which was the lowest. Rural cities had the highest average price per trip at $34.62, while urban had the lowest at $24.53. The average fare per driver was higher in rural cities at $55.49 whereas urban cities were the lowest at $16.57

Total Rides Total Drivers Total Fares Average Fare per Ride Average Fare per Driver
Rural 125 78 4,328 $34.62 $55.49
Suburban 625 490 19,356 $30.97 $39.50
Urban 1625 2,405 39,854 $24.53 $16.57

The multiline chart was created to show the Total Fares from January 1st to April 29th 2019 for each city type. During this time frame th total fares for each city type it shows the total fares for city types are the highest in all the weeks and the lowest in the rural cities. Also the third week of February has the highest total fare of any city type with an increasing demand. Urban cities also generated a lot of sales in the first and third week of March. End of February the total fares in all the city types showed to be at their highest.
